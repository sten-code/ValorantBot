# Install OpenCV

In order to install opencv you need to download the `opencv-4.9.0-windows.exe` file.
- https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.9.0

Open it and it will ask you to extract it somewhere, extract it into this (`Libs`) folder.
The folder should be named `opencv`, but in case it isn't rename it.
